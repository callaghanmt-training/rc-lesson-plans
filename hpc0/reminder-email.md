Hi Everyone,
 
This is a reminder that tomorrow is HPC0 - Introduction to Linux, which will be run via Microsoft Teams from ***{{ start-end }}***. You can find the slides for the workshop at https://bit.ly/hpc0linux and the interactive hackpad - ***{{ Session Hackpad link }}***
 
You can join the meeting using the link below:
 
***{{ Microsoft Teams Link }}***

We’d also ask you do some pre-session setup to help us get the session moving as quickly as possible.
 
For everyone:
 
If you haven’t already requested an account for the HPC via this link - https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=4c002dd70f235f00a82247ece1050ebc 
 
If you haven’t done this already please read the setup steps below but you won’t be able to login to ARC as you won’t have an account yet. We’ll give you a training account for the workshop.
 
For Windows Users:
 
For Windows users please consult our documentation page and video at https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/getting_started/logon.html#connecting-from-windows 
 
This covers downloading and configuring the software tool MobaXTerm which is required for everything we’ll be doing in the workshop.
 
For Mac/Linux Users:
 
MacOS and Linux users do not need MobaXTerm but can use your builtin Terminal application. You should follow the steps outlined in the bitesize video titled “Connecting to ARC off-campus via Linux/MacOS” on this page (https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/help/videos/) and read carefully the documentation section here (https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/getting_started/logon.html#connecting-from-linux-macos-systems) on connecting from Linux and MacOS, especially the section about configuring SSH for off-campus connections.
 
Please attempt to read the documentation and watch the videos carefully and attempt the setup steps. If you have any problems don’t worry we will spend the start of the workshop making sure everyone is connected.
 
*Note: For cancellations, please inform IT Training by email (ittraining@leeds.ac.uk).*

Thanks
