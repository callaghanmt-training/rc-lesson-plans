We will have multiple breaks throughout the course and will take 1 hour for lunch at midday (lunch is not provided).

In order to fully participate in this hands on workshop you will need to register for an account with Rstudio.cloud (https://rstudio.cloud/plans/free). Please sign up for the Free Cloud plan as that will be satisfactory for all the work weâ€™ll do during the course.
We will also be using an interactive hackpad to share materials with you during the course which you can find here - {{ hackpad link }}
