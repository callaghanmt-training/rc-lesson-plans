# SWD1a: Introduction to Python Programming

SWD1b is our introductory course to programming in R for people with little or no previous programming experience. It uses plotting and visualising data as its motivating example based on an established research dataset. The course is suitable for attendees from all research domains and we will use a Web based programming environment (a RStudio Cloud) which means you will be able to apply the ideas you learn on the course straightaway without having to install any software at home or at work.

This course is delivered over Microsoft Teams as four 3h workshops over four weeks or 2 full day in person sessions.

## Learning objectives

- How to run R programs
- Using Posit RStudio editor
- Variables and data types in R
- Using builtin R functions
- Avoiding and fixing errors
- Using software other people have written (libraries)
- Reading tabular data and simple statistical analysis
- Plotting data with ggplot2
- R data structures: vectors, lists, dataframes, matrixes
- Repeating things using loops
- User defined functions
- Control flow: if and while statements

## Instructor todo

- [ ] - Familiarise yourself with [course notes](https://arctraining.github.io/swd1b-r/)
- [ ] - [Have an account on Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud/) 
- [ ] - Send a reminder email at most 24h before the start of the session outlining [pre course prep](#Pre-course-prep)

## Pre-course prep

This course **does** require pre course prep as we expect users to have registered for the Posit Cloud free tier or have a local installation of R and RStudio.

### Recommended setup steps

In June 2022 this course was run using [Posit RStudio Cloud](https://posit.cloud/), so all users require a google account to access that platform.

Otherwise instructions will need to be provided to users around installing a basic R setup. We would recommend installing R directly from the R project website or following our instructions to do this in the [IT Knowledge Base](https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=kb_article_view&table=kb_knowledge&sys_kb_id=4e1642d71b6fa4504d79b455464bcb13). 
Anaconda may also be used, especially if required to manage complex system dependencies.
