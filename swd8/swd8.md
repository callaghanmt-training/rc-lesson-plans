# SWD8: Introduction to Machine Learning

SWD8 is one of our intermediate level courses. 
It introduces machine learning and deep learning.
It aims to provide high-level, practical guidance to get started.
This can help you build intuitions and make good practices a habit.
The course is suitable for those with a working knowledge of Python, Linux, and HPC.
We will use a Web based programming environment (Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab), which means you will be able to apply the ideas you learn on the course straightaway without having to install any software at home or at work.
This course is delivered as an all-day workshop.

## Learning objectives

1. Understand the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning.
2. Know how to use key tools, including:
    - [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
    - [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/)
    - [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/)
3. Be aware of good practices for data, such as pipelines and modules.
4. Be aware of good practices for models, such as hyperparameter tuning, transfer learning, and callbacks.
5. Be able to undertake distributed training.

## Instructor to do

- [ ] Familiarise yourself with [course book](https://arctraining.github.io/swd8_intro_ml/)
- [ ] [Own a Google account](https://colab.research.google.com/) and have previously accessed [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/)
- [ ] Send a reminder email at most 24 hours before the start of the session outlining [pre course prep](#Pre-course-prep)

## Pre-course prep

This course **does** require pre-course prep as we expect users to have either a Google account for accessing Google Colaboratory or an installed instance of Jupyter notebook/lab.
