Hi Everyone,

Thanks for signing up for our SWD1a Introduction to Python course happening next ***{{ Start date}}*** starting at ***{{ start time}}***.

The workshop will be hands on so be prepared to do some coding and will be held as a Microsoft Teams meeting (link available below), the workshop sessions will also be recorded.

Pre-workshop preparation:
In order to fully participate in this hands on workshop you will need to register for a google account so that you can use the Google Colaboratory service (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb). This will be the primary platform which we will use for learning how to code in Python so please do this ahead of the workshop, it doesnâ€™t take too long!

We will also be using an interactive hackpad to share materials with you during the course which you can find here - ***{{ Session Hackpad link }}***
 
***{{ Microsoft Teams Link }}***

If you have any questions or queries please get in touch.

Thanks,

***{{ Sender }}***
