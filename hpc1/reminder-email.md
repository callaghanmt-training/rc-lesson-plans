As with the our other sessions such as HPC0 this will be a hands-on, interactive session so please do the setup below to make sure you’re all connected for the start of the session tomorrow. See below for setup guidance:

For everyone:

If you haven’t already request an account for the HPC via this link - https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=4c002dd70f235f00a82247ece1050ebc 

If you haven’t done this already please read the setup steps below but you won’t be able to login to ARC as you won’t have an account yet. We’ll give you a training account tomorrow for the workshop.

For Windows Users:

For Windows users please consult out documentation page and video at https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/getting_started/logon.html#connecting-from-windows 

This covers downloading and configuring the software tool MobaXTerm which is required for everything we’ll be doing in the workshop.

For Mac/Linux Users:

MacOS and Linux users do not need MobaXTerm but can use your builtin Terminal application. You should follow the steps outlined in the bitesize video titled “Connecting to ARC off-campus via Linux/MacOS” on this page (https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/help/videos/) and read carefully the documentation section here (https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/getting_started/logon.html#connecting-from-linux-macos-systems) on connecting from Linux and MacOS, especially the section about configuring SSH for off-campus connections.

Please attempt read the documentation and watch the videos carefully and attempt the setup steps. If you have any problems don’t worry we will spend the start of the workshop making sure everyone is connected.

Thanks,
